Quick Start Guide to Using SASS with Visual Studio (2019)

I needed a way to introduce SASS into a project I'm working on, without bogging down or adding technical overhead to the other developers on my team. The compromise for complex build systems is a Visual Studio extension called "Web Compiler" by Mads Kristensen. 

- [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebCompiler)

Once it's setup, it runs automatically in the background. If it detects a chance to a SASS file listed in the configuration file it will build both the CSS and minified CSS files for you.
